  Three green bottles hanging on the wall,
  Three green bottles hanging on the wall,
  But if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
  There'll be two green bottles hanging on the wall.

  Two green bottles hanging on the wall,
  Two green bottles hanging on the wall,
  But if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
  There'll be one green bottles hanging on the wall.

  One green bottle hanging on the wall,
  One green bottle hanging on the wall,
  But if one green bottle should accidentally fall,
  There'll be no green bottles hanging on the wall.
